            <h3><a href="#">University Executives</a></h3>
            <p>Decentralization with active management participation in our institution is best exemplified in SIMATIC. The organizational hierarchy incorporated into the University’s framework comprises of the Vice Chancellor and Director heading the university and superintending the Registrar and Dean. The Registrar of the University heads a team with Deputy Registrar and Joint Registrar. The Director and Registrar supervise the Deans of all the institutions. Individual institutions have Associate Deans and two heads for every department (Administrative and Academic). The Associate Deans report to the Director and the Dean regarding their designated affairs and head a team of Assistant Deans. The Heads of each Department are in charge of their team of teaching and non-teaching faculty.</p>
